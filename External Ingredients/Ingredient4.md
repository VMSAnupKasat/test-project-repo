# Test External Ingredient Four

>[!NOTE]
>SI Customer Innovation (CI) is currently piloting the concept of Innovation Cookbooks, Recipes and Ingredients.
>[!IMPORTANT]
> The data in here is not to be used, or assumed to be real in any way. It is simply included to test the concepts.

## Overview

>[!NOTE]
> The focus of this section is to help the reader quickly determine if this ingredient may help to solve their customer problem.

In this section we will cover:

* The problem space we selected it to addresses. This is the technical capability, not the higher level business use case. For example, some 3D tools can do modelling and rendering, but we might have selected this particular tool just for its modelling capabilites, prefering something else for rendering. How the IP is used to solve a higher level business use case is the responsibility of the recipe that uses it. This section may include a short introductory video on how we use this IP within Microsoft.
* The maturity of this guidance and the External IP it relates to i.e., how itâ€™s been used so far and its effectiveness/impact (e.g., time savings).
* Its limitations, constraints, exclusions and deployment options (e.g., cloud, hybrid, on-prem).
* The commercial implications of applying it e.g., licensing costs or conditions. This is both for Microsoft during development and the customer once deployed.
* The known risks when using this External IP. Ideally this will also included recommendations for managing those specific risks.

## High-level Architecture of the External IP

>[!NOTE]
> Here we cover the high level architecture of the External IP. This will most likely be a link, or links, to existing documentation created by the owner of the IP. Will will only create new content when absolutely necessary.

## Guidance on implementing the External IP

>[!NOTE]
> Here we will provide any specific guidance on using the External IP to address the problem we have selected it for.

In this section we will cover:

* Any specific guidance on using it within Microsoft e.g., does its use indicate the need for an AI Ethics review or are there internal standards that need to be applied to its use.
* Generic guidance on using the IP. This will most likely be a link, or links, to existing documentation created by the owner of the IP. Will will only create new content when absolutely necessary. This will typically cover areas such as:
  * How to acquire and deploy
  * Training materials
  * Roadmaps
  * FAQs etc.

## Key contacts (internal and potentially external)

>[!NOTE]
> The aim of this section is to inform the reader of where they may be able to get help in applying this recipe.

## Alternatives considered and why not selected

>[!NOTE]
> Finally we want to prevent the reader from going down a blind alley persuing alteratives that have been discounted for good reason e.g., things that we have already tried and proven not to work.
