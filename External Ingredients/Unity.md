## Overview

Unity is a game engine tool for making 3D applications and sometimes 3D content​, like Xamarin but for 3D applications.

It is generally used for:

* Industrial tools​
* Prototypes​
* Research projects​
* Pre-viz for films​
* Animated web and tv series

### The Problem Space

We have selected it for use in building custom 3D applications and immersive 3D applications. It is suited to a situation where you have access to .Net developers​, you want to go fast​ and you’re targeting XR (the biggest reason Unity has a footprint within MS)​.

### Maturity

Unity is a very mature tool within the industry.

We have used it on a number of projects such as the Baxter virtual ICU prototype

### Limitations, constraints, exclusions and deployment options

We do not generally use it for 3D modelling. Although it is sometimes used to create content, it is not a prefered tool for content creation. Tools like Maya, Max, Blender are used for content creation and can ouput content that Unity can consume.

You should not use Unity if you need source level access​, if you want the highest visual fidelity possible​ or if you don’t have any developers who can program​.

Pros of Unity

* Easy to start​
* Small investment​
* Multi-platform​
* Docs and forums are public and indexed by major search engines​
* Lots of free and cheap add-ons​
* It’s the MR king (i.e. MRTK)​
* Great community​
* Well defined support (LTS releases)​
* Big features sometimes deliver​
* Ggreat developer experience (kind of)​

Cons of Unity

* Closed source​
* Quixotic feature ambitions​
* Uunresponsive to community requests​
* Mediocre visual fidelity​
* Ddeclining developer experience​
* A bit grubby (merging with Ironsource, ads, etc)​

### Commercial Implications

>[!NOTE]
>TODO: The commercial implications of applying it e.g., licensing costs or conditions. This is both for Microsoft during development and the customer once deployed.

### Known Risks

>TODO: The known risks when using this External IP. Ideally this will also included recommendations for managing those specific risks.

## High-level Architecture of the External IP

>[!NOTE]
> TODO: Here we cover the high level architecture of the External IP. This will most likely be a link, or links, to existing documentation created by the owner of the IP. Will will only create new content when absolutely necessary.

## Guidance on implementing the External IP

### Microsoft Specific Guidance

>[!NOTE]
> TODO: Any specific guidance on using it within Microsoft e.g., does its use indicate the need for an AI Ethics review or are there internal standards that need to be applied to its use.
