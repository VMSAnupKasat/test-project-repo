# Release 3.0

## Overview

As Delivery teams embrace Leading Edge Delivery (LED), the top priority is to “Start Fast, Deploy for Use, and Iterate Quickly” so our customers can realize their business objectives faster. 

We must enable them to follow LED principles and practices in a simple, standard, and realistic manner.

### Asset IP Package & IP Component

In this update, we have improved the **Asset type** of user experience (UX). You can create asset IP package and IP component with IP details that include Work item, Repository, and other components as [**_enablers_**](https://tinyurl.com/8jeeu9mp). 

A package combines IP kits that you can use to accomplish meaningful objectives with consistency and quality. As a component is designed for a specific package, you can reuse the same across any number of packages.

## Explore Asset

Being a Chrysalis user, you can add assets and explore its features to a greater extent, such as **Register Asset Usage**, **Contribution project** and **_[more](https://tinyurl.com/2ua4jwd4)_**.


With Explore Assets, you can refine your searches by applying smart filters for the fields like Asset type, Scenario, and products available.


You can also add contributors and asset owners. In essence, we give you complete freedom to create Assets of your choice and assign them to owners for [_**approval**_](https://dev.azure.com/servicescode/Chrysalis/_wiki/wikis/ChrysalisV3-Help/20017/Package-Approval).

## Docs as Code
 
This feature is a newly introduced asset type. A markdown file format is used to define the content.


The defined content will be automatically published as an HTML page within the asset type using the DocFX library. you can view the content on the HTML page under the content tab of that asset.

## Bootstrap IP

In this release, we add an entirely new feature - Bootstrap. It allows you to create enablers (work items, repositories) on a specific target Devops environment. All LED-based delivery projects operate on the Bootstrap ecosystem. 

The goal of Bootstrap IP for each engagement is to jumpstart a Delivery project by using LED practices as Delivery IP.

Among the **key components** that would deploy during the Bootstrap process are:

- _Azure DevOps Project_<br>
- _Process template_<br>
- _Startup Work Items_<br>
- _Standard tools_<br>
- _Sample Application Repository_<br>
- _Sample Application Pipeline_<br>
- _EasyInsights Dashboard_<br>

The following are other major benefits of a **faster bootstrap** process:

- _Saves at least 4000 person days a year_
- _**IP Reuse** that leads to higher revenue generation and greater savings for the organization_
- _Rapid time-to-market for new **IP Packages/Components**_
- _Easy tracking of which IP Packages/Components are consumed in a Delivery Engagement_
- _Community can innovate using **InnerSource**_

## Role Based Access Control

An RBAC (Role Based Access Control) is maintained across the application to control access and grant privileges or restrict usage of the features to the users.

Users with the privilege to Chrysalis Admin can access RBAC through the link 'https://chrysalis.microsoft.com/manage'. This interface allow you to add or remove Chrysalis or ITSM admins. You will get an error message if you do not have permission.
