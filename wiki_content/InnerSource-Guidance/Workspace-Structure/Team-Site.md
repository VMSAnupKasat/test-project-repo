# Team Site

An important aspect of any InnerSource team is collaboration that goes beyond just pull request and issue information tracked in the [repositories](Repository.md). There is a need for space for more informal discussions, for binary documentation that is not the best for structured source control environments like Git and for supporting remote meetings. This is achieved through Team sites.

There is a single Team site for every Chrysalis project team.


## Team Owners

Core Team members need to be made owners of the Team site. As per Microsoft policies, this means that each IP team consists of at least 2 core team members.

## Access Rights

Given Chrysalis follows InnerSource principles, by default it is suggested that the Team is set up with public access for all Microsoft employees. This means that general channel and other default channels added would be visible to all users who want to join and learn or contribute.

To ensure Core team (trusted contributors) have their own private space for discussions, Core Team private channel with access granted to the Core team members can be created. All files, OneNote notes and other assets in this protected channel would be visible only to core team members.


## Linking Other Content Into Teams Site

To ensure efficient visibility into the teams work and work results, metrics, it is suggested that Teams site general channel and/or core team's private channel has additional tabs added, for example, to include:
