# Creating a Project

Once you are on the Projects page in the Chrysalis, you can perform the following steps to create a project- 

 - Browse to [**_Chrysalis_**](https://chrysalis.microsoft.com), click **Projects** dropdown and, then select **Explore Projects**.

- Click the **Create Project** button on the top right side of the page.
 
- Fill in the below necessary details of the Project from the **Initiate Project Creation** page and click the **Create Project** button.
     - `Project Type*`  [Refer to [**Selecting Project Types**](/Selecting-Project-Type.html if you are unsure which one to choose]
     - `Project Title*`
     - `Description`
     - `Motivation*`
     - `Industry*`
     - `Scenario*`
     - `Products*`
     - `Solution Areas`
     - `Roles`
     - `Tagline*`
     - `Keywords*`
     - `Microsoft Teams*` - [You can select one of the options : *Leverage existing Teams* **or** *Create a New Team* or *No Need for Teams for this Project*]
     - `DevOps Project*` - [You can select one of the options : *Create a New DevOps Project* **or** *Leverage existing DevOps Project*]
     - `Is this project open for others to join?*`
     - `Is this project sponsored?*`
     - `Do you have any associated ideas from Chrysalis?*`


-    If you want to associate ideas during Project setup, type in the first few letters of the Idea Title so Chrysalis can fetch it for you, select the Idea and click **Submit**.

- The InnerSource Project along `Microsoft Teams Team` and `DevOps Project` gets created instantly, depending on the Options selected during creation. If creation of `Microsoft Teams Team` and `DevOps Project fails during creation, an email will be triggered and sent to Chrysalis Admin, who will create them manually and will respond to you with the links in an email.
