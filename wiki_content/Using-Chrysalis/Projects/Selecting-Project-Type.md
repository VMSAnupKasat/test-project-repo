# Selecting Project Type during Project Creation

To support few business groups such as CSU, CSS, CSE within MCAPS, an New Project Type can be created with few additional details to be collected during Project creation. Few of these project types require Approvals from SMEs within the business function to avoid duplicates and to align the priorities.

- General [For all other groups, DO NOT require *Approval*]
- Customer Success Unit - Pilot [*Requires Approval*]
- CSS Innovation Hub [*Requires Approval*]
