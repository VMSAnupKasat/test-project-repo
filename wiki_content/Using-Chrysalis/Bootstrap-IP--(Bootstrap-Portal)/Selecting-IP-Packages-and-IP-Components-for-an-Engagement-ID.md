# Selecting IP Packages and IP Components for an Engagement ID - 

Once the Engagement id is created using Add Engagement, you can start adding the IP packages and IP components according to your requirement for bootstrapping.

`Note: `    You can add only Active IP packages and IP components to the list.


## Add IP Packages and IP Components- 

Both IP package and IP component can be added to an engagement. When you try to add an IP package to the list, include its associated components.

- Browse to **_[Chrysalis](https://aka.ms/chrysalis)_**, select **Bootstrap** from Assets menu.

- Under **My Engagement tab**, click the next icon.

- On the Engagement Details page, search for the active IP packages using the search text box on the left panel.

- Select the required IP package or IP component from the **Bootstrap list** tab and click the **Add** button.

- After adding the required IP packages and IP components from the left panel, you can **select or unselect** the same by clicking the check box on the right panel. 

`Note:` 

Once the IP packages and IP components are saved, you cannot remove them after completing the bootstrap process. 

- But you can add more IP packages and IP components for bootstrapping within the same list and then click the bootstrap button again.


- So, once you complete adding the required IP packages and IP components, click the **Save** button and, then click the **Bootstrap** button.


## Deselecting the IP packages and IP components: 

 - Select the **X** symbol from the top right of the IP packages and IP components list.
