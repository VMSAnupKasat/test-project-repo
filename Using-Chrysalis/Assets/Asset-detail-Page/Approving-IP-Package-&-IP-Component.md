# Approving IP Package and IP Component

You can view the status of an asset from the Assets detail page. 

Only Asset owners and Chrysalis Admin or ITSM Admin can **Publish/Activate** IP package or IP component Assets.

## Steps to be followed while approving the IP package / IP component:

1. Browse to [**_Chrysalis_**](https://aka.ms/Chrysalis/), select **Explore Assets** from the **Assets** menu.

2. Using filters on the top left side of the Explore Assets page, select Asset type filter as - IP package or IP component.

3. Select the **(Asset title)** from the search list.

4. On the Asset details page, select **Asset Version** dropdown and the **status** dropdown. You can change the status as needed.

`Note:` 

When the asset owner updates the status of the asset to Active, then it is approved.

## Following are the Asset status scenarios:<br>

1. Default status of newly created asset will be shown as **In Development**.
2. Status can be changed from **In Development** to **Active** only for extracted Assets.
3. Status can be changed from **Active** to **Deprecated**.
4. You can't change status of an **Active / Deprecated** asset to **In Development**.
5. Package should be Extracted before **Publish/Activate**.
6. Only **Published/Active** IP Components can be added as Associated Components for IP Package.
