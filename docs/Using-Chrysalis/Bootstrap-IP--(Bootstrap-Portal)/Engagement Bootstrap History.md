# Engagement Bootstrap History

The Bootstrap History tab from the Engagement Details page will show you the number of times the IP packages/IP components are bootstrapped and how often these IP packages/IP components were bootstrapped in the past.

## Bootstrap History view from the Engagement Details page

1. Select the required Engagement ID from My Engagements tab.

2. Select **Bootstrap History** tab.

3. Click the accordion from the left pane of the **bootstrap id**. It will expand the list of IP packages and IP components added under the specific bootstrap id.

4. When you click the Download logs button on the right pane, a file gets downloaded to your local drive, where you can refer to the log details with the specific package name or component listed.

`Note:`

- The first bootstrap id is default selected, and its specific package detail logs are viewable in the right panel.
- The corresponding package details will get expanded by default by selecting the parent bootstrap ID.
- When the package with no enablers but the associated component is bootstrapped, you cannot view the package's bootstrap history. However, you can view the history details for the associated components.
