# Engagement Users

Engagement users get either view or edit access that can be assigned only by chrysalis and ITSM Admins.

**Engagement Members** - have view-only access to those assigned engagements and bootstrap history of engagements.

**Engagement Bootstrappers** - have access to bootstrap the assigned engagements and add/remove packages from engagements.

## Add Engagement User-

1. Browse to **_[Chrysalis](https://aka.ms/chrysalis)_** , select **Bootstrap** from Assets dropdown.

2. Click the next icon from the selected engagement id row under the My Engagement tab.

### **_Key Points to note:_**

 - Users tab is visible only for Chrysalis/ ITSM Admins who can add, edit, and remove the Engagement Members and Engagement Bootstrappers.

 - When you associate an Engagement id with another Associated system id, the system will auto-capture the User details (Engagement User) under the Users tab.

- If the user is the same member in both the ids (Engagement and Associated), then it selects the highest role level (Engagement Bootstrapper).
