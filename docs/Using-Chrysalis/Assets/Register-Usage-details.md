- Search for the (Asset title) using [_**Explore Assets.**_](https://aka.ms/Explore-Assets)

- Select the (Asset title) from the search list, and on the asset detail page, click **Registered Usages** on the top right side under the About section.

- If you find the Registered Usages option disabled for any specific asset you select, it is because Zero Registered Usages exist.

- When you complete the bootstrap of an Engagement id, the ID details will get auto-captured under the Registered Usages on the About section.
