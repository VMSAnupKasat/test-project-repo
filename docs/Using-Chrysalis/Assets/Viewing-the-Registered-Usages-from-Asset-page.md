# Viewing the Registered Usages from Asset page

When you select the Register Usages under the About section from the (asset title) page, you can view the listed projects link and engagement id details. 

## Following are the steps to view the Registered Usages from the Asset detail page:

- Select **Explore Assets** from the Assets dropdown. 

- Search for the (Asset title) using [_**Explore Assets.**_](https://aka.ms/Explore-Assets)

- Select the (Asset title) from the search list, and on the asset detail page, click **Registered Usages** on the top right side under the About section.

- If you find the Registered Usages option disabled for any specific asset you select, it is because Zero Registered Usages exist.

- When you have an engagement that is bootstrapped successfully from the engagement details page, those engagement ids will get auto captured in Registered Usages under the About section on the asset detail page.
