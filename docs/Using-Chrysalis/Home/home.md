# Chrysalis  Home<br>

Chrysalis has three significant entities: Ideas, Projects, and Assets. It enables the InnerSource teams to connect between the entities in a meaningful way seamlessly.

InnerSource teams can practice InnerSource flow while working on the existing collaboration platforms. The rich metadata captured when adding these entities and the automated sync up with the well-known information source help the community develop valuable insights.

In a nutshell, the home page of Chrysalis includes Ideas, Projects, and Assets. Users can have a heads-up on the number of counts being contributed and implemented.
