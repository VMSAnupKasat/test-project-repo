# Why change anything?

Although IP management has been something that has been done for as long as we have Services organization in Microsoft, when we look at evolution of approach and our teams, different IP assets we are creating and projects we are delivering, there are challenges and needs identified that need to be addressed. These are grouped in 4 categories below.

## Governance of IP Lifecycle

- no unified approach and clear responsibilities across all ACAI teams,
- different success levels of involving community,
- limited contribution back after reuse â€“ feedback and updates (maintenance costs up, no single truth)
- weak insights into reuse, contribution, customer value
- IP fragmentation

## Discovery/reuse by field

- hard to consume content,
- need better support for sellers and pre-sales architects,
- high time to first estimate,
- wrong assumptions around IP depth + readiness resulting in delivery issues

## Consistency

- lack of consistency within previous domains/teams,
- use of different tools  hindering benefits in larger projects
- different feedback mechanisms
- no consistent requirements capturing
- no consistent delivery methodology

## Composition

- large projects need to realign/reassemble IP if many packages are brought in
- lack of consistency of guiding principles & constraints in BOM/architecture to drive easier composition at time of delivery
