# Insights At Multiple Levels

Driving contribution culture depends on having insights not just at the team level, but also at the level of organization and entire ACAI. This enables employees to showcase their contributions, allows managers to focus their team on contribution work, enables higher management to make investment decisions and prioritization.

Evergreen Delivery IP goal is to provide insights at multiple levels so that individuals, their teams (including their managers) and leadership can have access to aggregated metrics across multiple IP projects, not just a single IP repository. 

To achieve this, tools are needed to aggregate metrics from outside of the repositories, yet repositories should have these metrics being gathered.

## Individual Level

Individual level insights contain information about contribution of a single contributor across multiple repositories they have used, reported issues, provided other feedback or contributed to by working on IP content. 

These insights should support individual in their discussions with management as part of contributions review, also should be used to assign badges and promote best contributors by innersource PMs as part of the overall [community](innersource-community.md) of evergreen practitioners.

## Team Level

At the team level managers get insights about their employee contributions and about overall contribution of the team. This can be a tool for both evaluation of the employees, but also for managing team targets of contribution to IP work allowing managers to prioritize some people more on IP work, some on pre-sales for example to balance overall team contribution to IP with other activities.

For a longer term impact on the overall culture of contribution these insights need to go hand-in-hand with having team targets updated to ensure culture of contribution is one of the important elements being tracked.

## Organization Level

At organization level the insights are at the aggregation level of the entire ACAI team, for example, and allows leadership team to decide on the impact of IP being worked on, assess additional investment areas either in specific IP areas or overall culture support to ensure sustained focus on IP work.

Metrics of what IP is being worked on and how could be used at this level to track certain initiatives, for example, if there is a goal of increasing co-engineering with partners and customers, this could be tracked through analysis IP teams that are hybrid and involve also partner and customer contributions.
