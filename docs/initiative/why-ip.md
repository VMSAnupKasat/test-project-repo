# Why IP?

There is no real question of why IP when it comes to Services engagements. Reusing IP in Services engagements allow for:

- better positioning
- less effort/cost
- higher quality
- expected value

## Better Positioning

Existing experience allows better sales positioning with customers. Running sales campaigns aligned with IP enables scale.

## Less Effort/Cost

One of the main elements is use of less effort in pre-sales and delivery, reducing time to proposal or having shorter delivery timeframes.

## Higher Quality

Reuse of previous experience avoids the same problems, following proven practices results in higher quality and customer satisfaction.

## Expected Value

Customers engaging MCS still expect MS global experience and existing “products” to be used instead of pure custom system integration work. Reuse enables meeting this expectation and charging our premium.
