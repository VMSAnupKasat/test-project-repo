## Goals

Specific high level goals of the program are:

### Harmonize processes, Taxonomy and tools used

- Use modern delivery principles in IP management
- Allow for better composition into larger IP elements across teams

### Reduce IP Fragmentation

- Drive innovations back to original IP
- Achieve faster IP evolution
- Build larger assets using existing blocks, do not “fork”

### Drive More Community Involvement and Leadership

- Grow grassroots contribution for IP
- Use SAO team as supporting force,  not always as leading one
- Leverage strength of entire MCS to build and improve IP
