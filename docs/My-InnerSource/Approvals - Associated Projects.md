## Add Associated Project to Asset

Asset Owners can associate or tag any Projects to their Assets. While adding the project, the project owner receives an email notification for approval.

If you are the Project Owner, you can click the approval link from the email notification. It will redirect you to the **Approvals** tab in Chrysalis under the My InnerSource menu. You can either choose to approve or reject the request.

### Following are the steps to Approve/Reject the request

- Browse to [**_Chrysalis._**](https://aka.ms/chrysalis).

- Select the My InnerSource menu and click the Approvals tab.

- If you are the project owner, you can view all the request details from the requestor (Asset Owner) on the Approvals tab.

- Once the Asset Owner tags a **_[contributing project](https://aka.ms/Associate-Assets-to-a-Project)_** to their asset, you will receive an email notification that includes the asset title and project title with the approve/reject hyperlinks. 

`Note:` No approvals required, if you are the project and the asset owner. You can directly tag the project from the Edit Asset button.

- Selecting the approve/reject hyperlink on the email notification will redirect you to the Approvals tab under My InnerSource menu.

 - Below are the fields you can see on the main page of the Approvals tab.


|Title| Requested Date | Requestor | Type | Status |
|--|--|--|--|--|

- All the fields are filterable; after applying the filters, you can sort the fields.

- To view the pending approvals, apply the filter on the Status field and click anywhere on the selected row.

-  You can see the Asset and Project title, Requested Date, Requestor name, Status, and Notes.

- You can **Approve** or **Reject** the request as shown in the above image.

- You must enter your notes when you reject the request. You can approve the request without leaving any messages. 

- Once you submit the request, you can see the status changes immediately in the Status field under the Approvals tab.

- When you click on the status field with approved or rejected, you can see the decision label updated (approved/rejected) under Notes at the bottom of the page.

- If the request is approved, Asset Owner will receive an email notification of the approval. They can view the project linked or tagged to their asset in the contributing project field on the Asset detail page. 

- The Asset Owner will receive an email notification when you reject the request. On click of the Rejection status on the approvals tab, they can view the reason for rejection in the notes.

## Disassociating Project from the Asset

- To disassociate any project from an asset does not require permission from the project owner.

- Once the asset owner delinks the tagged project from the Asset detail page, the project owner will receive an email notification on the delink.
