# contributing.md Content

This page provides guidance about the approach and suggested structure of defining the **CONTRIBUTING.md** for the project represented by an evergreen repository.

## Introduction

Contribution file expends on the content of the [readme.md](./readme-content.md) by focusing specifically on the contribution aspects of the project. It must address three groups of the stakeholders doing "different types" of contributions:

- **project core team members** (trusted contributors) who are responsible not just for contributing but also welcoming contributions of and supporting other contributors and consumers
- **project contributors** who can provide different types of contributions depending on the type/depth of the IP - starting with updates to documentation and ending with contributions to the main IP elements of the solution managed in the repository
- **project consumers** who are using the *"product"* of the IP repository and can report back issues and also feature suggestions, additional feedback that can drive the priorities for the core team.

Although in general there is no hard rules around the format and content of the contribution file, as a general guidance and given the tools promoted by the Evergreen Delivery IP it is suggested to use:

- Markdown format for creation the file (`contributing.md`)
- Follow the general content structure described below.

## Suggested Structure

The structure of the contribution guidance file is suggested to include the sections listed below.

### Content Structure

Content structure must describe all the locations where important content of the overall project gets stored. Primarily it should focus on describing the structure of the files in the Teams file store and the structure of the repository that contains structured IP content.

### Contribution Process

Contribution process needs to provide the process details around providing different types of contributions by different roles within the overall project. This includes feedback and issues, this can include informal feedback during supported informal communication channels (e-mail, Teams calls), this must also include pull request based contribution of changes to the structured content.

Section must also describe the tracking approach for changes being made. Ideally all structured contributions and even changes in binary information storage as part of the Teams site must happen as a result of the issue being addressed in repository.

### Tools

This section should include information for the contributors on the types of tools that are used for managing the content, developing and building it, managing the contribution workflow, communicating, tracking important team metrics.

In addition to just listing tools it is important to include links to externally published materials or even additional information in repository describing how to deploy and configure these tools so the initial barrier of contribution is removed as much as possible.

## Example

[Example of the contributing.md](https://dev.azure.com/evergreen-delivery-ip/_git/docs?path=%2FCONTRIBUTING.md) file of the Evergreen Delivery IP guidance project itself is available in its repository.
