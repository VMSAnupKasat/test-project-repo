# Measurement Based Evolution

Key metrics identified as key for implementation of the evergreen approaches are defined in this section. Section covers external impact, internal impact metrics important at IP team level, and culture impact metrics that are more important at various organizational levels.

In addition to defining the levels of measurements envisioned and examples of the measures, this section also describes the approach for tracking and presenting measurement values.

## IP External Impact

- Customers/projects using
- Geo-distribution – timezones/countries using
- Cloud revenue impact
- Delivery value impact
- Customer satisfaction in projects used

## IP Internal Impact

- Repository stars
- Activity (contributors & contributions)
- Core team vs. external contributions
- Contributors by role/location
- Linked IP count
- Freshness: how often shows in queries made, used in SEE suggestions
- Time to proposal for opportunities linked to IP

## Culture Impact

- Aggregated external and internal metrics across MCS IP repos
- Partner and customer co-innovation repos metrics
- IP fragmentation metrics (the same solution area – many copies)
- Contribution, participation and consumption

More on various levels of culture impact measurements and how they can drive culture change see section [Insights at all levels](insights-at-all-levels.md).

## Tracking & Presenting

Given there are various tools used for the underlying implementation of evergreen repos (Git and ADO), there is a separate Teams environment used as IP forum environment for discussions and each of the lenses ahs its specific approaches, and impact of the IP in MCS engagements can be received only from the tools tracking sales and delivery (C1 and Virtuoso), getting measure values as defined above for insights into team collaboration aspects and business impact requires integration of multiple data sources.

To simplify gaining the insights, at individual team level PowerBI service is used to aggregate various available data sources and present the KPI information. For measurements over multiple teams and to provide cultural insights at the level of organization, additional centralized data aggregation tools are needed. This means that there are 2 implementation levels of providing measurements:

- guidance and tools (initial sample dashboards and information on how to configure them) at the level of a single team and providing team level insights,
- centralized metric aggregation over all registered distributed repositories and tools to ensure end-to-end visibility with appropriate security.
