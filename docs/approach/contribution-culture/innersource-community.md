# Innersource Community

Innersource community's main tasks are to be the engine behind:

- noticing, aggregating and sharing back best practices of doing evergreen delivery IP in ACAI back to other ACAI members,
- making sure evergreen delivery approach is evolving based on feedback and business goals,
- promoting contribution behaviors through showcases, badges and other gamification initiatives.

## Innersource Program Managers

Driving evergreen delivery program forward and also ensuring there is a constant promotion of the contribution is a significant effort if we are intentional about it. To support it, there is a need for dedicated PMs (ideally representing all timezones) who would be the drivers of the evergreen program. This means either part time or even full time innersource PMs are needed.

Innersource PMs for the technical implementation and guidance would rely on evergreen guidance team maintaining the implementation details, aligning on the level of integration with other teams (e.g., BEO team). In this sense innersource PMs would be taking the role of the product owners for the "evergreen delivery IP implementation core team".

## Innersource WW Community

Those participating in defining evergreen delivery IP approaches and guidance already have their own v-team, but to identity and promote best practices broader, an approach is to establish WW Community. The community co-leads are the same innersource PMs described earlier, yet the members should be representing all core team members working on IP so that they can exchange their experiences and learn about the latest tools and techniques available.

Use of community mechanisms that include elements concepts like SMEs, champs and regular community calls would be reusing the existing successful way of build out of a community of practice.
