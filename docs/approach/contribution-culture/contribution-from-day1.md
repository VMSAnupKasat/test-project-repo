# Contribution from Day 1

To have significant impact in contribution and to drive change towards more contributing culture pervasive in the organization, the practices and suggested behaviors need to be highlighted, promoted and enforced from day 1.

Therefore practices that other implementations of innersource approaches have used in other companies is to have contribution tools, expectations set up even during onboarding of all new resources. Of course these needs to be aligned also to goals of the teams and individuals and supported by leadership to achieved broader impact.

With this to ensure sustained contribution to drive evergreen delivery this is important to add the elements defined below to the onboarding of the employees into ACAI teams.

## Guidance on Innersource

Basic training on innersource principles and various roles in the overall evergreen delivery process is required - what core team members should do (aka trusted contributors), what should be done and what are the responsibilities of contributors, what are the best practices/patterns of running successful community.

This goal requires training materials developed and included in onboarding and can be achieved by leveraging [Innersource community](innersource-community.md).

## Walk-through of Evergreen Approach

Basic training on principles, approaches of specifically evergreen delivery IP approaches that are implementation of the innersource principles in ACAI. This set of training materials needs is developed and maintained as part of evergreen delivery IP initiative and its delivery needs to be included in onboarding experience.

## Request to Join the IP Team

Previous two points are about need, context and tools/resources that employees can use to start working on evergreen IP. But "practices makes perfect" thus, based on experience of other companies implementing innersource expectation/ask to have new employees start contribution to the IP that they are interested in and initially maybe do that by tackling "first issue" type of simpler issues is a great way to experience this approach in practice.
