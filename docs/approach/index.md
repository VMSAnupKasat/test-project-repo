# Overall Approach
Added for demo
This section defines the overall approach suggested for the IP development, innersource community building and discovery of delivery IP. It covers these three main areas looked at at part of the Evergreen Delivery IP initiative:

- [team model](team-model.md) that is based on the [innersource](../resources/innersource.md) approach, suggests the team model starting from defining the core team, describing the approach for managing contribution and discovery, it also touches on the tools suggested for use to implement the approach
- [modular ip asset management](diverse-delivery-ip.md) that should support diverse teams working on different set of IP assets (documentation, reference architecture, data models, scripts, code and components) and is based on the concept of "content lenses"
- [sustaining and growing ip contribution culture](contribution-culture/contribution-culture.md) that includes approaches suggested as part of the program to ensure contribution moves from current spots of IP contribution successes to more pervasive focus on IP contribution all up in ACAI.

## Principles

The main principles followed by the approach are:

- **gradual adoption** to ensure that teams can light up their existing IP assets (repos teams) with Evergreen Delivery approaches and that teams can start their adoption small and then grow as needed
- **flexibility of adoption** to support different approaches by different teams based on their needs, for example:
  - being able to roll out own documentation portal following guidance of the Evergreen Delivery IP starter kit guidance (more control, yet reuse of common approach and practices) or committing to centralized tools that get the documentation sources and host the documentation automatically via centrally managed tool set (less control, but lower barrier of entry)
  - choosing the lenses that are important for the IP in question and committing only to their specific BOM approach allowing other assets to be managed as the team wants
- **distributed sites/repos** are supported by the approach given that there are different tools and repos used today and there is no way this is going to change in the future; as a an example the tools that index the Evergreen IP repos are expected to enable registration of multiple distributed locations where repos are and ensure these all repos can be indexed
- **priority for repo based content** over use of SharePoint especially for the content that is not binary (Word documents etc) to ensure that full tracking of the collaboration is possible and all changes are visible, thus promoting the innersource openness
- **insights and feedback based improvement** based on innersource principles for the Evergreen Delivery IP initiative itself so that teams adopting the principles and working on their specific needs can contribute back common elements that would become more useful for others as well.

## Teams Following Evergreen Delivery

To ensure ACAI teams have as easy as possible way of adoption of the principles and approaches defined in this section overall evergreen delivery IP approach relies on implementation [guidance](../guidance/index.md) that is enhanced based on core team priorities, but even more so - based on those implementing approach and providing back feedback and contributions for new tools, lenses and best practices.
